The code and dataset accompanying the paper *"Exploring the Lattice Thermal Conductivity Model via Interpretable Machine Learning"* will be completed and made available after the paper is accepted.

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
